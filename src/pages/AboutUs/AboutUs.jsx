            <h1>What is an 'About Us' page?</h1>
          <p>
            An 'About Us' page is a spot for your
            founding story, a place to show off your business wins, and a sales
            page that answers the most pressing question new customers have
            about your business. What an 'About Us' page should be is a
            goal-oriented sales page, one that focuses on highlighting the
            biggest selling points of your story and brand at the top of the
            page, making a strong first impression on curious customers In
            Shopify’s customer trust research, we found that shoppers navigate
            to an About Us page to learn more about the brand and the people
            behind the products. Your 'About Page' should address those two
            curiosities shoppers have to help with decision making. Shoppers are
            also interested in a company’s mission. They’ll use the About Us
            page to determine if they share core values with the business and to
            decide if they want to shop with the business or not.
